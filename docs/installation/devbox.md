# Devbox

Add lefthook in the devbox environment.
lefthook already exists in the [Nix package](https://search.nixos.org/packages?channel=25.05&show=lefthook&from=0&size=50&sort=relevance&type=packages&query=lefthook)

```bash
devbox add lefthook@latest
```

**Note**: The devbox plugin for lefthook is maintained by the community. While we appreciate their contribution, the lefthook team cannot provide direct support for devbox-specific installation issues.
