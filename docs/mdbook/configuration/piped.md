## `piped`

**Default: `false`**

> **Note:** Lefthook will return an error if both `piped: true` and `parallel: true` are set

Stop running commands and scripts if one of them fail.

**Example**

```yml
# lefthook.yml

database:
  piped: true # Stop if one of the steps fail
  commands:
    1_create:
      run: rake db:create
    2_migrate:
      run: rake db:migrate
    3_seed:
      run: rake db:seed
```
