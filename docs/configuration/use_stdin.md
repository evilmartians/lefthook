# `use_stdin`

> **Note:** With many commands or scripts having `use_stdin: true`, only one will receive the data. The others will have nothing. If you need to pass the data from stdin to every command or script, please, submit a [feature request](https://github.com/evilmartians/lefthook/issues/new?assignees=&labels=feature+request&projects=&template=feature_request.md).

Pass the stdin from the OS to the command/script.

**Example**

Use this option for the `pre-push` hook when you have a script that does `while read ...`. Without this option lefthook will hang: lefthook uses [pseudo TTY](https://github.com/creack/pty) by default, and it doesn't close stdin when all data is read.

```bash
# .lefthook/pre-push/do-the-magic.sh

remote="$1"
url="$2"

while read local_ref local_oid remote_ref remote_oid; do
  # ...
done
```

```yml
# lefthook.yml
pre-push:
  scripts:
    "do-the-magic.sh":
      runner: bash
      use_stdin: true
```
