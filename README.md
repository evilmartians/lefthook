## Why Lefthook

* ### **Parallel execution**
Gives you more speed. [docs][config-parallel]

```yml
pre-push:
  parallel: true
```

* ### **Flexible list of files**
If you want your own list. [Custom][config-files] and [prebuilt][config-run] examples.

```yml
pre-commit:
  jobs:
    - name: lint frontend
      run: yarn eslint {staged_files}

    - name: lint backend
      run: bundle exec rubocop --force-exclusion {all_files}

    - name: stylelint frontend
      files: git diff --name-only HEAD @{push}
      run: yarn stylelint {files}
```

* ### **Glob and regexp filters**
If you want to filter list of files. You could find more glob pattern examples [here](https://github.com/gobwas/glob#example).

```yml
pre-commit:
  jobs:
    - name: lint backend
      glob: "*.rb" # glob filter
      exclude:
        - "*/application.rb"
        - "*/routes.rb"
      run: bundle exec rubocop --force-exclusion {all_files}
```

* ### **Execute in sub-directory**
If you want to execute the commands in a relative path

```yml
pre-commit:
  jobs:
    - name: lint backend
      root: "api/" # Careful to have only trailing slash
      glob: "*.rb" # glob filter
      run: bundle exec rubocop {all_files}
```

* ### **Run scripts**

If oneline commands are not enough, you can execute files. [docs][config-scripts]

```yml
commit-msg:
  jobs:
    - script: "template_checker"
      runner: bash
```

* ### **Tags**
If you want to control a group of commands. [docs][config-tags]

```yml
pre-push:
  jobs:
    - name: audit packages
      tags:
        - frontend
        - linters
      run: yarn lint

    - name: audit gems
      tags:
        - backend
        - security
      run: bundle audit
```

* ### **Support Docker**

If you are in the Docker environment. [docs][config-run]

```yml
pre-commit:
  jobs:
    - script: "good_job.js"
      runner: docker run -it --rm <container_id_or_name> {cmd}
```

* ### **Local config**

If you are a frontend/backend developer and want to skip unnecessary commands or override something in Docker. [docs][usage-local-config]

```yml
# lefthook-local.yml
pre-push:
  exclude_tags:
    - frontend
  jobs:
    - name: audit packages
      skip: true
```

* ### **Direct control**

If you want to run hooks group directly.

```bash
$ lefthook run pre-commit
```

* ### **Your own tasks**

If you want to run specific group of commands directly.

```yml
fixer:
  jobs:
    - run: bundle exec rubocop --force-exclusion --safe-auto-correct {staged_files}
    - run: yarn eslint --fix {staged_files}
```
```bash
$ lefthook run fixer
```

* ### **Control output**

You can control what lefthook prints with [output][config-output] option.

```yml
output:
  - execution
  - failure
```
