## Usage

Lefthook is easy to use. Once you configure and setup you can forget that it even exists and rely on the magic underneath.

See:

- [**Usage**](./docs/usage.md) of **lefthook** CLI utility.
- [**Configuration**](./docs/configuration.md) details for `lefthook.yml`
- [**Wiki**](https://github.com/evilmartians/lefthook/wiki) for other information.
- [**Discussions**](https://github.com/evilmartians/lefthook/discussions) if you want to ask a question, suggest a feature, or report a bug.

## Why Lefthook

* ### **Parallel execution**
Gives you more speed. [Example](./docs/configuration.md#parallel)

```yml
pre-push:
  parallel: true
```

* ### **Flexible list of files**
If you want your own list. [Custom](./docs/configuration.md#files) and [prebuilt](./docs/configuration.md#run) examples.

```yml
pre-commit:
  commands:
    frontend-linter:
      run: yarn eslint {staged_files}
    backend-linter:
      run: bundle exec rubocop --force-exclusion {all_files}
    frontend-style:
      files: git diff --name-only HEAD @{push}
      run: yarn stylelint {files}
```

* ### **Glob and regexp filters**
If you want to filter list of files. You could find more glob pattern examples [here](https://github.com/gobwas/glob#example).

```yml
pre-commit:
  commands:
    backend-linter:
      glob: "*.rb" # glob filter
      exclude: "application.rb|routes.rb" # regexp filter
      run: bundle exec rubocop --force-exclusion {all_files}
```

* ### **Execute in sub-directory**
If you want to execute the commands in a relative path

```yml
pre-commit:
  commands:
    backend-linter:
      root: "api/" # Careful to have only trailing slash
      glob: "*.rb" # glob filter
      run: bundle exec rubocop {all_files}
```

* ### **Run scripts**

If oneline commands are not enough, you can execute files. [Example](./docs/configuration.md#script).

```yml
commit-msg:
  scripts:
    "template_checker":
      runner: bash
```

* ### **Tags**
If you want to control a group of commands. [Example](./docs/configuration.md#tags).

```yml
pre-push:
  commands:
    packages-audit:
      tags: frontend security
      run: yarn audit
    gems-audit:
      tags: backend security
      run: bundle audit
```

* ### **Support Docker**

If you are in the Docker environment. [Example](./docs/configuration.md#cmd-template).

```yml
pre-commit:
  scripts:
    "good_job.js":
      runner: docker run -it --rm <container_id_or_name> {cmd}
```

* ### **Local config**

If you a frontend/backend developer and want to skip unnecessary commands or override something into Docker. [Description](./docs/usage.md#local-config).

```yml
# lefthook-local.yml
pre-push:
  exclude_tags:
    - frontend
  commands:
    packages-audit:
      skip: true
```

* ### **Direct control**

If you want to run hooks group directly.

```bash
$ lefthook run pre-commit
```

* ### **Your own tasks**

If you want to run specific group of commands directly.

```yml
fixer:
  commands:
    ruby-fixer:
      run: bundle exec rubocop --force-exclusion --safe-auto-correct {staged_files}
    js-fixer:
      run: yarn eslint --fix {staged_files}
```
```bash
$ lefthook run fixer
```

* ### **Optional output**

If you [don't want to see](./docs/configuration.md#skip_output) supporting information:

```yml
skip_output:
  - meta #(version and which hook running)
  - success #(output from runners with exit code 0)
```
