     src="./logo_sign.svg">

Fast and powerful Git hooks manager for Node.js, Ruby or any other type of projects.

* **Fast.** It is written in Go. Can run commands in parallel.
* **Powerful.** It allows to control execution and files you pass to your commands.
* **Simple.** It is single dependency-free binary which can work in any environment.

## Install

With Go:

```bash
# Using Go >= 1.19
go install github.com/evilmartians/lefthook@latest
```

See **[Installation guide](./docs/install.md)** for different installation instructions.

## Usage

Edit the config:
```yml
# lefthook.yml

# This hook executes on `git commit`
pre-commit:
  parallel: true # All commands will be executed concurrently
  commands:      # Commands section
    # `js-lint` will call `npx eslit --fix` only on staged files.
    # It will filter staged files by glob.
    # If there are no files left after filtering, this command will be skipped
    js-lint:
      glob: "*.{js,ts}"
      run: npx eslint --fix {staged_files} && git add {staged_files}

  # `ruby-test` will skip execution only when in a merging or rebasing state.
  ruby-test:
    skip:
      - merge
      - rebase
      run: bundle exec rspec
      fail_text: Run bundle install

  # `ruby-lint` has `files` option which is a git command for replacing
  # the {files} template. Then lefthook applies glob pattern to the result.
  # If the final list is empty, the command will be skipped.
  # Otherwise the {files} templace will be replaces with list.
  #
  # Note: if a template has surrounding quotes, they will be used to wrap
  # each file in the list.
  # Double quotes `"` and single quotes `'` are supported.
  ruby-lint:
    glob: "*.rb"
    files: git diff-tree -r --name-only --diff-filter=CDMR HEAD origin/master
    run: bundle exec rubocop --force-exclusion --parallel '{files}'

# You can provide more hooks.
pre-push:
  commands:
    spelling:
      files: git diff --name-only HEAD @{push}
      glob: "*.md"
      run: npx yaspeller {files}
```


Install the hooks:
```bash
lefthook install
```

Start working with Git:
```bash
git add -A
git commit -m 'chore: Add lefthook'
git push
```

## Why Lefthook

* ### **Parallel execution**
Gives you more speed. [Example](./docs/full_guide.md#parallel-execution)

```yml
pre-push:
  parallel: true
```

* ### **Flexible list of files**
If you want your own list. [Custom](./docs/full_guide.md#custom-file-list) and [prebuilt](./docs/full_guide.md#select-specific-file-groups) examples.

```yml
pre-commit:
  commands:
    frontend-linter:
      run: yarn eslint {staged_files}
    backend-linter:
      run: bundle exec rubocop --force-exclusion {all_files}
    frontend-style:
      files: git diff --name-only HEAD @{push}
      run: yarn stylelint {files}
```

* ### **Glob and regexp filters**
If you want to filter list of files. You could find more glob pattern examples [here](https://github.com/gobwas/glob#example).

```yml
pre-commit:
  commands:
    backend-linter:
      glob: "*.rb" # glob filter
      exclude: "application.rb|routes.rb" # regexp filter
      run: bundle exec rubocop --force-exclusion {all_files}
```

* ### **Execute in sub-directory**
If you want to execute the commands in a relative path

```yml
pre-commit:
  commands:
    backend-linter:
      root: "api/" # Careful to have only trailing slash
      glob: "*.rb" # glob filter
      run: bundle exec rubocop {all_files}
```

* ### **Run scripts**

If oneline commands are not enough, you can execute files. [Example](./docs/full_guide.md#bash-script-example).

```yml
commit-msg:
  scripts:
    "template_checker":
      runner: bash
```

* ### **Tags**
If you want to control a group of commands. [Example](./docs/full_guide.md#skipping-commands-by-tags).

```yml
pre-push:
  commands:
    packages-audit:
      tags: frontend security
      run: yarn audit
    gems-audit:
      tags: backend security
      run: bundle audit
```

* ### **Support Docker**

If you are in the Docker environment. [Example](./docs/full_guide.md#referencing-commands-from-lefthookyml).

```yml
pre-commit:
  scripts:
    "good_job.js":
      runner: docker run -it --rm <container_id_or_name> {cmd}
```

* ### **Local config**

If you a frontend/backend developer and want to skip unnecessary commands or override something into Docker. [Description](./docs/full_guide.md#local-config).

```yml
# lefthook-local.yml
pre-push:
  exclude_tags:
    - frontend
  commands:
    packages-audit:
      skip: true
```

* ### **Direct control**

If you want to run hooks group directly.

```bash
$ lefthook run pre-commit
```

* ### **Your own tasks**

If you want to run specific group of commands directly.

```yml
fixer:
  commands:
    ruby-fixer:
      run: bundle exec rubocop --force-exclusion --safe-auto-correct {staged_files}
    js-fixer:
      run: yarn eslint --fix {staged_files}
```
```bash
$ lefthook run fixer
```

* ### **Optional output**
If you don't want to see supporting information:
```yml
skip_output:
  - meta #(version and which hook running)
  - success #(output from runners with exit code 0)
```
