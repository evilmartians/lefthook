## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you have found a security issue in Lefthook, please **do not** create a new issue in the GitHub repository. Instead, please send an email to [lefthook@evilmartians.com](mailto:lefthook@evilmartians.com?subject=Lefthook%3A%20security%20issue) describing what the problem is and how to reproduce it. We will get in touch with you!

Please note that Lefthook, as a CLI tool, executes arbitrary commands and scripts from its configuration file by design. This is intended behavior. Feel free to join the discussion on [issue #229](https://github.com/evilmartians/lefthook/issues/229).
