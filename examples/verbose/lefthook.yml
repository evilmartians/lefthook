# This hook executes on `git commit`
pre-commit:
  parallel: true  # All commands will be executed concurrently
  commands:       # Commands section
    # `js-lint` will call `npx eslit --fix` only on staged files.
    # It will filter staged files by glob.
    # If there are no files left after filtering, this command will be skipped
    js-lint:
      glob: "*.{js,ts}"
      run: npx eslint --fix {staged_files} && git add {staged_files}

    # `ruby-test` will skip execution only when in a merging or rebasing state.
    ruby-test:
      skip:
        - merge
        - rebase
      run: bundle exec rspec

    # `ruby-lint` has `files` option which is a git command for replacing
    # the {files} template. Then lefthook applies glob pattern to the result.
    # If the final list is empty, the command will be skipped.
    # Otherwise the {files} templace will be replaces with list.
    #
    # Note: if a template has surrounding quotes, they will be used to wrap
    # each file in the list.
    # Double quotes `"` and single quotes `'` are supported.

      glob: "*.rb"
